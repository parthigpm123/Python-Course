'''
Empty Statement:

This is the simplest type of statement, performing no action.

It is represented by the pass keyword.

The pass statement is often used as a placeholder where Python's syntax requires a statement but the program logic does not yet require any specific action. This is common in incomplete function definitions, loops, or conditional blocks.
