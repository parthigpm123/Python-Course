'''   
    Elif
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

Example
'''
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif b < a:
  print("a and b are equal")
  
  
''' 
  Short Hand If
If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.

Example
One line if statement:

'''

a = 200
b =33
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
