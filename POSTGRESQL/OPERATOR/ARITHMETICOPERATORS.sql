SQL arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations on numeric values within SQL queries. These operators are fundamental for data manipulation and analysis in relational databases.
The primary SQL arithmetic operators include:
Addition (+): Adds two numeric values.
Code

    SELECT 10 + 5 AS SumResult;
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one numeric value from another.
Code

    SELECT 10 - 5 AS DifferenceResult;
    
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numeric values.
Code

    SELECT 10 * 5 AS ProductResult;

Division (/): Divides one numeric value by another.
Code

    SELECT 10 / 5 AS QuotientResult;

Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.
Code

    SELECT 10 % 3 AS RemainderResult;


These operators can be used with literal values, column values from tables, or a combination of both to perform calculations within SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses of SQL queries. They are essential for tasks such as calculating totals, averages, differences, and transforming data for reporting and analysis.
