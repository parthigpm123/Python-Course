What is Data Type?

Data types are used to represent the nature of the data that can be stored in the database table. For example, in a particular column of a table, if we want to store a string type of data then we will have to declare a string data type of this column.

Data types mainly classified into three categories for every database.

1.String Data Types-1.varchar(n) 2.char(n) 3.text

2.Numeric Data Types 1.integer 2.smallint 3.bigint 

 FLOAT VALUE 4.numeric(p,s) 5.real 6.double precision

3.Date and Time Data Types 1.date 2.time 3.timestamp 4.timestamptz 5.interval

4.boolean Data Types 1.true/false 2.null





PostgreSQL offers a comprehensive set of data types for various data storage needs. These types are broadly categorized as follows:
1. Numeric Types:
Integers: smallint, integer, bigint (for different ranges of whole numbers), serial, smallserial, bigserial (auto-incrementing integers).

Floating-Point Numbers: real, double precision (for approximate numeric values), numeric, decimal (for exact numeric values with specified precision and scale).

Monetary: money (for currency values).

ðŸ§  Explanation
Data Type	  Precision	                 Description
REAL	~6 decimal digits	Rounded to 12345.679 (loss of precision)
DOUBLE PRECISION	~15 decimal digits	Keeps most digits accurately
NUMERIC(20,10)	Exact (10 digits after decimal)	Fully precise, no rounding errors

ðŸ’¡ When to Use
Scenario	 Recommended     Type
Temperature,  measurements	REAL
Scientific    calculations	DOUBLE PRECISION
Currency, prices, totals	NUMERIC(p, s)



2. Character Types:
char(n): Fixed-length string, padded with spaces if shorter than n.
varchar(n): Variable-length string with a maximum length of n.
text: Variable-length string with virtually unlimited length.

3. Temporal Types:
date: Stores dates (year, month, day).
time: Stores time of day (hour, minute, second).
timestamp, timestamptz: Stores date and time, with timestamptz including time zone information.
interval: Stores time periods.

4. Boolean Type:
boolean: Stores logical true, false, or NULL.

5. Binary Types: bytea: Stores binary strings (byte arrays).

6. Network Address Types: inet: Stores IPv4 and IPv6 hosts and networks, cidr: Stores IPv4 and IPv6 networks, and macaddr: Stores MAC addresses.

7. Bit String Types:
bit(n): Fixed-length bit string.
bit varying(n): Variable-length bit string.

8. Geometric Types:
point, line, lseg, box, path, polygon, circle: For representing geometric objects.

9. Other Specialized Types:
uuid: For storing Universally Unique Identifiers.
json, jsonb: For storing JSON data, with jsonb offering more efficient storage and indexing.
xml: For storing XML data.
enum: For creating custom enumerated types with a predefined set of values.
array: For storing arrays of other data types.
tsvector, tsquery: For full-text search capabilities.
