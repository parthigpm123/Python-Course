In SQL, a JOIN is a clause used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Its primary purpose is to retrieve data that is spread across multiple tables in a relational database, presenting it as a single, unified result set. 


Here are the different types of the Joins in PostgreSQL:

INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, combining each row from the first table with all rows from the second table


-- Example of INNER JOIN in PostgreSQL
SELECT testproduct_id, product_name, category_name
FROM testproducts
INNER JOIN categories ON testproducts.category_id = categories.category_id;
