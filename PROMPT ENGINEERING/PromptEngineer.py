'''What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of creating effective prompts that enable AI models to generate responses based on given inputs. Prompt engineering essentially means writing prompts intelligently for text-based Artificial Intelligence tasks, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In the case of such text-based tasks, these prompts help the user and the model generate a particular output as per the requirement. These requirements are efficiently added in the form of prompts and hence the name Prompt Engineering. '''
